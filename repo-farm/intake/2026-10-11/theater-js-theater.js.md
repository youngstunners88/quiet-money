# Intake: theater-js/theater.js

- **Source:** https://github.com/theater-js/theater.js
- **Looked at:** 2026-10-11 11:47 UTC (public metadata and text only; nothing was cloned, installed or run)
- **What it says it is:** n/a

| fact | value |
|---|---|
| stars, dates, forks | unknown: GitHub's API is not reachable from this machine for this repository |

## Red flags

- **LOW `license-unknown`:** no LICENSE file at the top level and the API was not reachable: check by hand
- **LOW `partial`:** GitHub API answered 403 (rate limited, private or gone): facts below come from raw files only

## Verdict (a person or the review step fills this in)

- [ ] **USE**: wire into the engine now (behind a provider interface, with a test)
- [ ] **TRIAL**: try in a sandbox copy with throwaway credentials, then decide
- [ ] **PARK**: useful later; name the phase
- [x] **KILL**: not useful, or not safe; record why so nobody re-evaluates it

Questions to answer before the box is ticked: which pipeline stage does it serve (ideate, script, voice, visuals, render, post, measure, sell)? Does it beat what we already run on cost, quality or speed? Does it run headless on a keyless CI runner? Is there a steal worth taking (a prompt, a table, a script) even if the tool itself is not used?

## Decision (2026-10-11)

**KILL**, pipeline stage: render.

A small typing-effect library with no licence file at the top level. Kinetic text is already done with GSAP in the phrase card.

**Worth taking:** Nothing.

**Only the owner can:** None.
